# EveryMatrix
All files as used by Everymatrix.com Limited/Gammix.com to fraud casino players. 

View ```www/daddy_project``` for the main project. All files come directly from Everymatrix.com, as same as Mondogaming.eu sports solution these files are incredibly unsafe and looks like created by monkey, yet per request to anyone can receive 1TB of transactions that directly implicate and criminalize it's operation.

These are obviously unsafe as files retrieved by exploiting the backend, in this case main bug on how got hacked is in the avatar upload not actually checking file extension/payload making able to upload PHP shell.

It shows how games are changed, for example Pragmatic Play, Evolution Gaming, Relax Gaming and so on.

EveryMatrix's real owner (not on paper) is David G. Wainwright (hollywoodtv).
